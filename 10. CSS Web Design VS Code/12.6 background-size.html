1. auto: The default value. The background image is displayed at its original size.

.selector {
  background-size: auto;
}

2. cover: The background image is scaled proportionally to cover the entire content area of the element. Some parts of the image may be cropped if the aspect ratio of the image and the container do not match.

.selector {
  background-size: cover;
}

3. contain: The background image is scaled proportionally to fit completely within the content area of the element. This ensures that the entire image is visible, but there may be empty space around it if the aspect ratios don't match.

.selector {
  background-size: contain;
}


4. length values: You can specify specific width and height values in pixels (`px`) or other length units to set a custom size for the background image. For example, `background-size: 200px 100px;` would set the background image size to 200 pixels in width and 100 pixels in height.

.selector {
  background-size: 200px 100px;
}


5. percentage values: You can use percentage values to scale the background image based on the width and height of the containing element.

.selector {
  background-size: 50% 75%;
}


Here's an example of using the `background-size` property in CSS:
